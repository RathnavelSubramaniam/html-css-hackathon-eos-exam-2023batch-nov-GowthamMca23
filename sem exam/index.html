        <h2 id="first">INTRODUCTION</h2>
            <p>A photograph (also known as a photo, image, or picture) is an image created by light falling on a photosensitive surface, usually photographic film or an electronic image sensor, such as a CCD or a CMOS chip.
               Most photographs are now created using a smartphone or camera, which uses a lens to focus the scene's visible wavelengths of light into a reproduction of what the human eye would see. 
               The process and practice of creating such images is called photography.</p>
                <br>
        <h2 id="second">HISTORY</h2>
            <p>The first permanent photograph, a contact-exposed copy of an engraving, was made in 1822 using the bitumen-based "heliography" process developed by Nicéphore Niépce. 
               The first photographs of a real-world scene, made using a camera obscura, followed a few years later at Le Gras, France, in 1826, but Niépce's process was not sensitive enough to be practical for that application: a camera exposure lasting for hours or days was required.
               In 1829 Niépce entered into a partnership with Louis Daguerre and the two collaborated to work out a similar but more sensitive and otherwise improved process.</p>
                <br>
        <h2 id="third">TYPES OF PHOTOGRAPHS</h2>
            <P>Non-digital photographs are produced with a two-step chemical process. 
               In the two-step process the light-sensitive film captures a negative image (colors and lights/darks are inverted).
               To produce a positive image, the negative is most commonly transferred ('printed') onto photographic paper. 
               Printing the negative onto transparent film stock is used to manufacture motion picture films.
               Alternatively, the film is processed to invert the negative image, yielding positive transparencies. 
               Such positive images are usually mounted in frames, called slides.</P>
                <br>
        <h2 id="fourth">PRESERVATION</h2>
            <p>Ideal photograph storage involves placing each photo in an individual folder constructed from buffered, or acid-free paper.
               Buffered paper folders are especially recommended in cases when a photograph was previously mounted onto poor quality material or using an adhesive that will lead to even more acid creation.
               Store photographs measuring 8x10 inches or smaller vertically along the longer edge of the photo in the buffered paper folder, within a larger archival box, and label each folder with relevant information to identify it.
               The rigid nature of the folder protects the photo from slumping or creasing, as long as the box is not packed too tightly or under filled.
               Folder larger photos or brittle photos stacked flat within archival boxes with other materials of comparable size.</p>
                <br>
        <h2 id="fifth">POLYSTERS ENCLOSURES</h2>
            <p>The most stable of plastics used in photo preservation, polyester, does not generate any harmful chemical elements, nor does it have any capability to absorb acids generated by the photograph itself. 
                Polyester sleeves and encapsulation have been praised for their ability to protect the photograph from humidity and environmental pollution, slowing the reaction between the item and the atmosphere.
                 This is true, however the polyester just as frequently traps these elements next to the material it is intended to protect. 
                 This is especially risky in a storage environment that experiences drastic fluctuations in humidity or temperature, leading to ferrotyping, or sticking of the photograph to the plastic. 
                 Photographs sleeved or encapsulated in polyester cannot be stored vertically in boxes because they will slide down next to each other within the box, bending and folding, nor can the archivist write directly onto the polyester to identify the photograph. 
                 Therefore, it is necessary to either stack polyester protected photographs horizontally within a box, or bind them in a three ring binder.</p>
                <br>
        <h2 id="sixth">HANDLING AND CARE</h2>
            <p>It is best to leave photographs lying flat on the table when viewing them.
                 Do not pick it up from a corner, or even from two sides and hold it at eye level.
                 Every time the photograph bends, even a little, this can break down the emulsion.
                 The very nature of enclosing a photograph in plastic encourages users to pick it up.
                 users tend to handle plastic enclosed photographs less gently than non-enclosed photographs, simply because they feel the plastic enclosure makes the photo impervious to all mishandling.
                 As long as a photo is in its folder, there is no need to touch it; simply remove the folder from the box, lay it flat on the table, and open the folder.
                 If for some reason the researchers or archivists do need to handle the actual photo, perhaps to examine the verso for writing, they can use gloves if there appears to be a risk from oils or dirt on the hands.</p>
                <br>
        <h2 id="seventh">MYTHS AND BELIEFS</h2>
            <P>Because daguerreotypes were rendered on a mirrored surface, many spiritualists also became practitioners of the new art form. 
               Spiritualists would claim that the human image on the mirrored surface was akin to looking into one's soul. 
               The spiritualists also believed that it would open their souls and let demons in.
               Among Muslims, it is makruh (disliked) to perform salah (worship) in a place decorated with photographs.
               Photography and darkroom anomalies and artifacts sometimes lead viewers to believe that spirits or demons have been captured in photos.</P>
                <br>
        <h2 id="eigth">LEGALITY</h2>
            <p>The production or distribution of certain types of photograph has been forbidden under modern laws, such as those of government buildings,[11] highly classified regions,[12] private property, copyrighted works,[13][14] children's genitalia,[15] child pornography and less commonly pornography overall.
               [16] These laws vary greatly between jurisdictions.</p>
